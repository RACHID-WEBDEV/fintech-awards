                                    <p>
                                        We are careful about inviting or accepting a company as a sponsor. Our sponsors will share the limelight with us on the Awards night and throughout the communications cycle. Some of our sponsors stick with an award category. Others work with us much more closely.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 className="tracking-wider md:leading-normal lg:text-[36px] text-xl">How We Work</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        We have a sustainable and consistent team. These include our photographers to our judges. We work with partner companies that share our values. This approach has undoubtedly made the awards stronger year on year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We understand the role of sponsorship in helping us to celebrate the Award winners. We also understand that our sponsors need a ‘Win’ themselves. We have carefully aligned sponsors with categories. Our team works with partners’ teams to find the best awareness and positioning for each. In whatever way a sponsor chooses to work with the Nigerian Fintech Awards, they have the same commitment as us.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 className='tracking-wider md:leading-normal lg:text-[36px] text-xl'>Why Sponsor? </h2>
                                    <p>

Whether you’re looking to align your brand with innovations in the Nigerian Fintech industry or benefit from inclusion in our marketing campaign, the Nigerian Fintech Awards have something that’s right for you.
                                    </p>
